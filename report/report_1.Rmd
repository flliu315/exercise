excercise_1: lean R using data from R package

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

cleaning the current environment

```{r}
library(ade4)
data(package = "ade4")
data("doubs")
str(doubs)
```

there are 4 list, each with several obs.

```{r}
mydata <- doubs$env
head(mydata)
```

check the first 6 lines of the data 

```{r}
mydata <- mydata[,-1]
head(mydata)
```

delete the first column of the data

```{r}
hist(mydata$alt,
     col = "green",
     main = "altitude distribution",
     xlab = "altitude")
```

check the distribution of the variable of altitude

```{r}
library(corrplot)
res1 <- cor(mydata)
res1
```

calculate the coefficients of these variables

```{r}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(mydata[,2:6])
```

find which are strongly correlated
